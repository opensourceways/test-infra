// assignees. This only uses leaf approvers to find the closest
// approvers to the changes.
// - We find a subset of suggested approvers from current
// approvers, suggested approvers and assignees, but we remove those
// that are not useful considering suggested approvers and current
// approvers. This uses the full approvers list, and will result in root
// approvers to be suggested when they are assigned.
// We return the union of the two sets: suggested and suggested
// assignees.
// The goal of this second step is to only keep the assignees that are
